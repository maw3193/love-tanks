TANKS!!!

This is written to play around with physical entities as something other than a box of shapes thrown at each other.

Bugs
====

* Zooming in and out seems centred on world origin
* Input handling via Slab is probably suboptimal

Features
========
* Saving & Loading
  - world state, new/save/load buttons
    - stick class name in the dict.
    - how do I get the class from the name...
    - assume I already know the type, I guess...
* UI
  - Refactor entity info and camera info into separate menus
  - one window for selected entity
  - Creating a new order menu
  - time controls
* Terrain
  - a map grid of some kind.
* Combat
  -
* AI
  - entities that can move towards a point/object DONE
  - able to attack each other DONE
  - variant of WanderOrder, HuntOrder, which generates AttackOrders
    - when at the top of the order queue, it generates move orders
    - all tanks have a sensor to check if they detect something new.
    - HuntOrder generates an AttackOrder in response.
    - what happens to old moveOrders?
* multiplayer???
  - events that get passed over network.
