TANKS!!!

This is written to play around with physical entities as something other than a box of shapes thrown at each other.
I want:
* UI
  - one window for selected entity
  - key binding menu
  - Creating a new order menu
  - time controls
* Terrain - a map grid of some kind.
* tanks
  - shooting each other with guns
* AI
  - entities that can move towards a point/object DONE
  - able to attack each other

* multiplayer???
  - events that get passed over network.
